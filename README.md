# Profile
Leonard Hambrecht is a highly motivated researcher with a strong commitment to biodiversity conservation.
His research primarily focuses on the assessment and comparison of functional diversity within natural forest ecosystems in Australia.
By utilizing advanced lidar technology, specifically very high point density data from ULS and TLS, Leonard effectively evaluates the structural complexity of individual trees.
This approach enables him to assess the functional diversity of forests and gain insights into the competition for resources among trees. 

He joined [TerraLuma](https://terraluma.net/) in 2019, where he had the privilege of contributing to lidar data collection for the documentary [The Giants](https://www.thegiantsfilm.com/), highlighting the captivating story of Bob and the natural forests in Tasmania. 

In addition to his role at TerraLuma, Leonard volunteers as a data scientist at the respected NGO [Sensing Clues](https://sensingclues.org/).
He actively supports their efforts to employ remote sensing products for environmental monitoring and the detection of human disturbance in Africa and Europe.
Through his contributions, Leonard aims to contribute to the collective endeavour of preserving and protecting our planet's invaluable ecosystems. 

# Active Projects
The ARC project aims to assess biodiversity using remote sensing data, focusing on the characterization of biodiversity through trait-based functional diversity.
This approach utilizes ecologically meaningful traits derived from high-resolution remote sensing RS data.
Part of the project leverages the benefits of high point density lidar data obtained from both UAV-based (ULS) and Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) technologies. 

By employing these advanced lidar technologies, the project enables the segmentation of individual trees, facilitating a detailed analysis of their structure.
This segmentation process not only allows for a comprehensive assessment of functional diversity but also enables the evaluation of functional diversity based on the specific traits exhibited by each individual tree. 

Multiple study sites serve as practical case studies for comparing and assessing functional diversity.
By analysing and comparing the functional diversity across these study sites, the project aims to contribute valuable insights into the understanding and management of biodiversity.
